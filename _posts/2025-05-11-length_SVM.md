### Problem Set Up
Suppose we have a Linear SVM with a hard margin, and

 $$ H(x) = \mathbf w^T\mathbf x + b $$
 
is the hyperplane that serves as the boundary function. The vector $ \mathbf x $ represents an instance of the feature space. Show that the size of the margin, $ M $ is

$$ \frac{2}{||w||} $$

Here is a quick visual to help grasp the problem at hand:
