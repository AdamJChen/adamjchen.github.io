### Problem Set Up
Suppose we have a Linear SVM with a hard margin, and

 $$H(x) = \mathbf w^T\mathbf x + b$$
 
is the hyperplane that serves as the boundary function. The vector $\mathbf x$ represents an instance of the feature space. Show that the size of the margin, $M$ is

$$\frac{2}{||w||}$$

Here is a quick visual to help grasp the problem at hand:

<img 
     style="display: block; 
           margin-left: auto;
           margin-right: auto;
           width: 30%;"

     width="300" 
     height="300" 
  />
